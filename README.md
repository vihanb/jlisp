# JLisp

A Lisp dialect written in JavaScript

## How to build

You will need Git, Node.js, NPM and Ruby.

Execute these commands:

    git clone https://github.com/tuxcrafting/jlisp.git
    npm install
    ./make

And you can now launch `bin/jlisp` for the interpreter and `bin/jlispi` for the REPL.
